# Open Source Cloud Architecture | XeroCodee

Welcome to the Open Source Cloud Architecture repository. This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts for cloud services across AWS, GCP, and Azure. It is intended to serve as a resource for Cloud and DevOps engineers and developers, facilitating the deployment and management of cloud infrastructure.

## What's Inside

- `cloudformation/`: AWS CloudFormation templates for quick and reliable provisioning of AWS infrastructure.
- `terraform/`: Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud infrastructure as code across multiple cloud providers.
- `docs/`: Documentation on how to use the scripts, best practices, and architectural explanations.

## Coming Soon

- CloudFormation SDK: An extensive toolkit to generate CloudFormation scripts from high-level specifications.
- Terraform Modules: Reusable Terraform modules for different types of cloud infrastructure deployments.
- GCP and Azure Architectures: Expanding the repository to include Google Cloud Platform and Azure templates and scripts.
- IaC Tools: Addition of scripts for other IaC tools like Ansible, Pulumi, etc.
